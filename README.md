# HERMES - a Robot Management System (RMS)

Hermes - _a Robot Management System (RMS)_ - is a set of tools to remotely pilot a robot.


It is designated for robots with a single embedded master system (computer, raspberry, etc..) sending orders to a 
set of slave sub-systems (itself or arduino(s)) connected via serial (extendable to other protocols).
It is composed of three main parts:
- `arduino`: an arduino "slave" client - _designed to receive and execute orders from the control script to actuators 
  (servos, sensors, etc...)._ 
- `backend`: a python control script - _designed to pilot de robot by sending appropriate orders to the appropriate 
  slave._ 
- `frontend`: a web interface - _designed to give a comprehensive interface to pilot the robot via the python script._

# Try it!

**Current develops happen on the `main` branch**:
```
git clone --branch main https://github.com/dclause/hermes.git HERMES
```

# Motivation

HERMES is an experimentation of my own to unify the control of some of my personal robots :
- a custom 3D-printed [ZeroBot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2800717) - _an open-source project by Max Kern._
- a modified [Watney](https://github.com/nikivanov/watney) like robot - _an open-source by Nik Ivanov._
- my own designed rover robot
- a modified/motorized 3D printed [GladOS replica](https://ytec3d.com/glados-lamp) - _an open-source project by Yvo de 
  Haas._
- a full [InMoov robot](https://inmoov.fr) - _an open-source project by GaÃ«l Langevin._

Inspired by [MyRobotLab](http://myrobotlab.org/), it <ins>tries</ins> to be lighter (to be used on a raspberry), easier and 
  more user-friendly.


***
**The HERMES project is done on my spare time, it does not intend to compete with any other solutions you might want to 
try.**
