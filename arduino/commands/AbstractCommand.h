/**
 * Class AbstractCommand: all commands must implement this class.
 *
 * A command ca be:
 *  - An action that is required by the master to be done on the slave board.
 *      Ex.: turn a motor, orientate a servomotor, light a led...
 *  - An input that is required to be read and sent back to the master.
 *      Ex.: value of a push button, a PIR sensor, a distance sensor...
 *  - A generic purpose command, generally for the protocol itself.
 *      Ex.: a heartbeat, a handshake, an ACK, etc...
 *
 * A command can either be received (from the backend) or sent (to the backend).
 *
 * A command is a suite of 8bits words:
 *  - starting with an uint8_t (one of the MessageCode dictionary) that will be mapped to the appropriate class by
 *  the CommandFactory.
 *  - followed by a payload which is an arbitrary number of bytes for arguments that are read by the receivePayload_().
 *
 * @note
 * Command codes are mapped to actual commands via the CommandFactory by registering the command class to the factory
 * keyed by the appropriate command code. This is done via the conjunction usage of the macros `COMMAND_DECLARATION`
 * and `REGISTER_COMMAND(N, T)`.
 * @see CommandFactory.h
